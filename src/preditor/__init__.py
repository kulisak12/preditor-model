"""The Preditor package serves as the backend for typing assistance.

It provides completions while typing, even in the middle of a sentence.
For Czech, it allows the user to substitute a word in a sentence
and automatically adjusts the forms of the surrounding words.

It uses an existing large language model without any additional fine-tuning.
A single language model handles all of the tasks mentioned above.
